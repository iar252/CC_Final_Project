function Panda(){
	
}

/*

going to create vectors, movement, display function, update function, will be interacting with the other tabs

plan: 
well designed/drawn bamboo sticks are going to crowd the array of pandas, but using time, im going to
make the bamboo sticks disappear. 
after a certain amount of bamboos are gone, the panda's smile begins to disappear and the eyes close
